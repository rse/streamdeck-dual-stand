Origin
------

This custom stand was originally designed for the [msg Filmstudio](msg.direct/filmstudio-trailer),
the filmstudio of [Dr. Ralf S. Engelschall](mailto:ralf.engelschall@msg.group) (CTO) at [msg](https://www.msg.group). 
This studio is driven by a control room of about two dozen Stream Deck XL
devices, spread on five desks. The primary position of the event director uses such a lot
of necessary keys to control a production that the Stream Deck XL devices initially had up to three pages. As this
was too impractical during an event, the position now consists of a desk
with 11 Stream Deck XL devices and nearly no necessary paging on each device, so the
director can reach all keys immediately. This was only possible through
stacking the Stream Deck XL devices with the help of this custom dual stand,
which Noah S. Engelschall designed in 3D in [Blender](https://blender.org) and printed on a
[Bambu Lab X1](https://bambulab.com/de-de/x1) device.
